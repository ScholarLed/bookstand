# ScholarLed Open Source Bookstand

ScholarLed is a consortium of open access book publishers. Together we are developing ways for small-scale, scholar-led Open Access presses to grow and fourish. Our shared bookstand is designed to promote Open Access publishing and to present our collective catalogue at conferences, fairs and events. In the spirit of the consortium we are making the design for this low cost, portable bookstand available under a **CC BY-NC** licence, encouraging you to adopt it to your own needs.
